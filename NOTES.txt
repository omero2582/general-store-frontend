RTK Query-
-cache time starts counting down, only after a query loses all of its
subscribers. Once it finishes counting, it clears it from the cache
-you can use multiple query hook calls, and it will not refetch a new
call and will just use the previous one. This property is called 'keepUnusedDataFor'

with above in mind, we can call 'useMeQuery()' at the outermost component
when the app loads, and then check this same status by including the same
hook call in innner components

Details for this are in producstApiSlice:
keepUnusedDataFor <- defaults to 60s = time the data will remain in the cache, 
// after last component referencing it umounts. Also available per endpoint
